🌍 The Long Walk
🎒 A Narrative Point-and-Click Adventure Game About Transport Challenges in South Africa

The Long Walk is a narrative-driven, point-and-click adventure game that highlights the transportation struggles faced by many communities across South Africa.

Set in an informal-settlement-inspired environment, you step into the shoes of a young high-school student from a disadvantaged community. Through puzzles and interactive storytelling, you'll navigate the challenges of simply trying to get to school — challenges that reflect real-world issues millions experience daily. 🚶‍♂️🚌

🎯 Purpose

The goal of this game is to raise awareness about the lack of safe and reliable transport for large portions of the South African population.

By playing The Long Walk, we hope players gain empathy for these lived experiences and are encouraged to learn more about the systemic issues at play.

🌱 Change begins with awareness — and awareness begins with you.
